  This domain name is based on three things that annoy the hell out of me:
  
  <ul>
    <li>Being called "Mr."</li>
    <li>Some <a href="https://twitter.com/manoelribeiro">jerk kid</a> that gave me a random nick name.</li>
    <li>People that somehow manage to mess up my last name.</li>
  </ul>

  Credit to <a href="https://twitter.com/emilianoucl">DREmiliano</a> for putting all three things together to really bug me...
